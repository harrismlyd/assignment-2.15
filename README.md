# Assignment-2.15

1. What is needed to authorize your EC2 to retrieve secrets from the AWS Secret Manager?

2. Derive the IAM policy (i.e. JSON)?

3. Using the secret name prod/cart-service/credentials, derive a sensible ARN as the specific resource for access

# Answers 

1. An IAM role that has permission to access Secrets Manager needs to be created.
This IAM role will be attached to the EC2 instance.
A policy for the IAM role needs to be created to allow permissions to read the secrets.
